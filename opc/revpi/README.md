## RevPi Core 3 Configuration

This directory contains all resources related to the hardware configuration
of the [KUNBUS Revolution Pi Core 3](https://revolution.kunbus.de/) as well as
the DI / DO modules used in the scope of this project.

After finishing the [basic configuration](https://github.com/CVH-Lernfabrik/serverless_plc/blob/master/opc/README.md),
the user can connect to a web application hosted on the device on port 80. The
default login can be found on the sticker on the side of the RevPi Core.

Attention: It is highly recommended to change the default credentials after the
first login!

Once logged in, the setup of the DI / DO modules can be done via a pre-installed
software tool called [PiCtory](https://revolution.kunbus.com/tutorials/was-ist-pictory/),
which can be found under the "Apps" tab.

For further information concerning the hardware configuration process, cf. this
[official tutorial](https://revolution.kunbus.com/tutorials/quick-start-guide/?noredirect=en_US).
